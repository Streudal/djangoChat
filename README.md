# djangoChat
Python chat creation for the Apex Legends Friend Finder application.

# server.py
This starts the locally hosted test server. You must start this before you running client.py. This is easy to do through a CLI by running this command (in windows): >> python .\server.py 

# client.py
Once the server is running you can run a client by calling the client.py file from a CLI by running this command 
(in windows): >> python .\client.py

In the CLI two things will appear that need to be typed in for now:
1.) Enter host: localhost
2.) Enter port: 33000

Then the GUI window that pops up will welcome you to the chat room and the first thing to do is type your name in the box and hit enter then your chat is ready to go!

To get a new client in the chat room just open up a new termianl and repeat the steps above.
